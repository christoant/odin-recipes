    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To begin making Malabar Mutton Biryani Recipe, prep all the ingredients
        well. Once done, take the ingredients for biryani masala in a mixer
        grinder and grind to a smooth paste with the help of little water. Also
        soak basmati rice in water for 10-15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the ghee in a cast iron or heavy bottomed kadai; Once the ghee is
        hot but not yet smoking, add the sliced onions and saute till golden
        brown in colour and caramelized. You can take these onions out and add
        them at the end of the recipe for a nice texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now into the same pan, add the sliced tomatoes and saute well till
        mushy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the tomatoes are mushy, add in ginger garlic paste, curd and
        freshly ground biryani masala paste, cardamom, turmeric powder, and
        coriander powder and saute a bit till the raw smell of ginger garlic
        paste goes away. Add the mutton pieces and cook well with lid closed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the ghee in a biryani pot and add in the remaining spices- green
        chillies, mint, coriander leaves, cashew nuts, raisins, bay leaves and
        saute till brown in colour.

      <li>
        Add milk, curd, and water. Wait till it comes to a boil and then add
        rice. Add salt to taste. Lower the heat, cover the pan with a lid and
        continue to cook for 15 minutes or till teh rice is done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take another biryani pot, place half the rice into it. Now layer the
        cooked flavourful mutton on the top of the rice. Add the remaining rice
        on top of the mutton. Spread the contents of the pan to make an even
        layer. Make random holes through the rice with a spoon and pour into
        each a little saffron milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a few spoons of ghee, caramelized onion, cashew nuts and raisins
        on the surface and cover tightly. Serve the biryani hot.
